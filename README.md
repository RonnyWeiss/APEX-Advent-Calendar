This project is a Region Plug-in for Oracle APEX that let's you easily use a nice advent calendar for christmas time. 
You can also use this code without APEX (index.html). 

The Images are made by myself and are free to use. But you can also use other images.

The configuration of the Plug-in is really easy:
